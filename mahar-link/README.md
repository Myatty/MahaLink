# Mahar Link

## Project Introduction

Our project aims to enhance communication and coordination among organizations, volunteers, and non-profit entities involved in Myanmar flood relief efforts. Often, supplies are delivered multiple times to the same location while other areas remain underserved due to a lack of systematic communication. This platform will provide a centralized solution to ensure efficient distribution of resources, enabling better support and contribution to affected areas.

## Vision

To create a centralized communication platform that ensures efficient and equitable distribution of resources during Myanmar flood relief efforts.

## Mission

To enhance coordination among organizations, volunteers, and non-profits, preventing redundant supply deliveries and ensuring all affected areas receive the necessary support.
