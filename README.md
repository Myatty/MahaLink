# Mahar Link :rocket:

## Introduction :tools:

Our project aims to enhance communication and coordination among organizations, volunteers, and non-profit entities involved in Myanmar flood relief efforts. Often, supplies are delivered multiple times to the same location while other areas remain underserved due to a lack of systematic communication. This platform will provide a centralized solution to ensure efficient distribution of resources, enabling better support and contribution to affected areas.
